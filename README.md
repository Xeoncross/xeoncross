Programmer for over 10 years. Over 2,800 different developers have started/watched my projects here. Stackoverflow lists in me in the top <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/99923/xeoncross">1% of develpers</a>. I've designed backend systems, shipped features to millions of people and rewriten applications to meet demand.

Experiance building queues, insurance onboarding, streaming encryption wrappers, audio extraction, natural language processing (NLP), video transcoding, content systems (blogs, forums, etc..), documentation generators, single sign on (SSO) providers, WebRTC, web crawlers, and many more diverse projects. 

User interfaces with next.js, react, bootstrap, material-ui, and styled-components (powered by flexbox and typescript).

I'm a domain and services designer. I approach foundations with a focus on the business ideas and assertions that make up the core of a product or suite. I've mentored developers, written roadmaps, and started company-wide training initiaves to solve scaling problems through teaching and sharing.

I can scale teams and applications or build them from scratch.
